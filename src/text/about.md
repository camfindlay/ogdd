### About

The purpose of the Open Government Data Survey is to present the survey results to show where agencies and government as a whole are at, and to display key insights.

Further it allows agencies to see where they should focus their efforts, and where they are strong. It poses opportunities for cross agency support, helps to scale inputs and deliver better Open data outcomes.

### Methodology

The survey questions were based on the [Open Data Maturity Model](https://theodi.org/article/open-data-maturity-model-2) developed by the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org). The model is a tool that organisations can use to assess their strengths and weaknesses in publishing and consuming open data, and identify actions for improvement. In essence it is a tool to work towards good practice generally with data management, governance, use and release, but with an open data lens. Unlike the model, our survey was designed to give an indicative picture of where things are currently at, rather than conduct an in-depth assessment of agencies.
